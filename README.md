## Motivation

This tool aims to empower your local development with following features:

* Provide a rich and powerful log viewer like Stackdriver log viewer.
* Make logs persistent and searchable.

## Install
```
go get -u github.com/addsict/gaelv/...
```

## How to use

1. Run your app server (`dev_appserver.py`) with `--logs_path=<log_path>` option.
```
dev_appserver.py app.yaml --logs_path=/tmp/log.db
```

2. Run `gaelv` with same `--logs_path` option.
```
gaelv --logs_path=/tmp/log.db
```

3. Open http://localhost:9090/ on your browser.

## Console mode

If you want to see logs in the console instead of a browser, run `gaelv` with `--console` option.

```
gaelv --logs_path=/tmp/log.db --console
```

## FAQ

### The latest logs doesn't appear immediately.
Unfortunately, new logs are buffered in the app engine log service for 5 seconds.  
There is no workaround for it now except modifying sdk source code, so please change the value `_MIN_COMMIT_INTERVAL` to `0` in the file `/usr/local/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/google/appengine/api/logservice/logservice_stub.py`.  
You can find your sdk root path by: `gcloud info --format="value(installation.sdk_root)"`

### Can I use this tool for GAE/Java?

This tool uses the App Engine log service, which is not supported in GAE/Java local development server.  
Supported runtimes are following,

* GAE/Go
* GAE/Python
* GAE/PHP
